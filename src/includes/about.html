    <p>
        I'm a <ins>back-end/devops</ins> developer based in Argentina with a passion for building digital stuff.<br>
        I enjoy solving real life problems and business needs with code, specially when it comes to infrastructure and automation.<br>
        When I'm not online I'm probably hanging out with my wife, my cats or friends.
